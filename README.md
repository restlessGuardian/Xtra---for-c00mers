## Explanation of the fork

1.What's changed?</br>
      Couple of buttons and the search bar have been removed from the app, preventing user from discowering/browsing/accessing channels which are not on the follwed          channel list.
      
2.Who is this for?</br>
      This is for people who have problem with self controll when it comes to explicit content on twitch. Mainly for NoFap and seemen retention communities. This is not      intended as a parental controll measure for your kids. Seek to make them strong rather than safe. </br>
      
3.How do I use this mess you made?</br>
      Sadly this requires a relatively leanghty setup for now. </br>
      -First off download "open.clean.version.giantGuardian.apk" from latest release of my fork. </br>
      -Install it.</br>
      -Open up the app and follow every stream you are interested in (spend some time making this list as it will be impossible to add more later)</br>
      -Download "closed.version.giantGuardian.apk" from my fork and install it, regularely, over the previous Xtra app on your android device.</br>
      -Enjoy safety and reliability of twitch without coom bait.</br>

If you have any trouble following the instructions, shoot me a message, I will be happy to help you set it up </br>
I want to express my deep gratitude for everyone who contributed to this project and allowed me the opportunity to have access to Twitch.
